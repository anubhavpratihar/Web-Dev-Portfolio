<h1>About Me</h1>
<br><hr>

<p> 
  I am a passionate individual with a strong interest in full stack web development. With a B.Tech degree in 
  Electronics and Communications Engineering from BMSIT&M, I have acquired a solid foundation in technical 
  concepts and problem-solving skills. My journey in web development began when I discovered the immense 
  potential of creating dynamic and interactive websites that enhance user experiences.
<p>
  During my freelance work on Upwork Inc., I had the opportunity to collaborate with diverse clients on various
  web development projects. These experiences allowed me to refine my skills in front-end and back-end 
  development, as well as database management. From designing visually appealing interfaces using HTML, CSS, 
  and JavaScript to implementing robust server-side logic with frameworks like Node.js, I have gained valuable
  hands-on experience across the full stack.

  Additionally, I had the chance to explore technical writing during a content writing internship I pursued 
  during the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic. This experience provided me with insights into 
  effectively communicating complex concepts and ideas in a concise and accessible manner.

<p>
  Combining my technical background, proficiency in full stack web development, and a knack for technical 
  writing, I am excited to take on new challenges and contribute to building innovative and user-friendly web 
  solutions. I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my skill set and stay updated with the latest 
  trends in the ever-evolving field of web development.
